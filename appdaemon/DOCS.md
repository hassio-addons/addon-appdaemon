# Home Assistant Community Add-on: AppDaemon

[AppDaemon][appdaemon] is a loosely coupled, multithreaded, sandboxed Python
execution environment for writing automation apps for Home Assistant home
automation software. It also provides a configurable dashboard (HADashboard)
suitable for wall mounted tablets.

## Installation

The installation of this add-on is pretty straightforward and not different in
comparison to installing any other Home Assistant add-on.

1. Click the Home Assistant My button below to open the add-on on your Home
   Assistant instance.

   [![Open this add-on in your Home Assistant instance.][addon-badge]][addon]

1. Click the "Install" button to install the add-on.
1. Start the "AppDaemon" add-on
1. Check the logs of the "AppDaemon" add-on to see if everything went well.

:information_source: Please note, the add-on is pre-configured to connect with
Home Assistant. There is no need to create access tokens or to set your
Home Assistant URL in the AppDaemon configuration.

This automatic handling of the URL and token conflicts with the
[AppDaemon official documentation][appdaemon]. The official documentation
will state `ha_url` and `token` options are required. For the add-on, however,
this isn't needed.

## Configuration

**Note**: _Remember to restart the add-on when the configuration is changed._

Example add-on configuration:

```yaml
log_level: info
system_packages:
  - ffmpeg
python_packages:
  - PyMySQL
  - Pillow
```

**Note**: _This is just an example, don't copy and past it! Create your own!_

### Option: `log_level`

The `log_level` option controls the level of log output by the addon and can
be changed to be more or less verbose, which might be useful when you are
dealing with an unknown issue. Possible values are:

- `trace`: Show every detail, like all called internal functions.
- `debug`: Shows detailed debug information.
- `info`: Normal (usually) interesting events.
- `warning`: Exceptional occurrences that are not errors.
- `error`: Runtime errors that do not require immediate action.
- `fatal`: Something went terribly wrong. Add-on becomes unusable.

Please note that each level automatically includes log messages from a
more severe level, e.g., `debug` also shows `info` messages. By default,
the `log_level` is set to `info`, which is the recommended setting unless
you are troubleshooting.

These log level also affects the log levels of the AppDaemon.

### Option: `system_packages`

Allows you to specify additional [Alpine packages][alpine-packages] to be
installed to your AppDaemon setup (e.g., `g++`. `make`, `ffmpeg`).

**Note**: _Adding many packages will result in a longer start-up time
for the add-on._

### Option: `python_packages`

Allows you to specify additional [Python packages][python-packages] to be
installed to your AppDaemon setup (e.g., `PyMySQL`. `Requests`, `Pillow`).

**Note**: _Adding many packages will result in a longer start-up time
for the add-on._

#### Option: `init_commands`

Customize your environment even more with the `init_commands` option.
Add one or more shell commands to the list, and they will be executed every
single time this add-on starts.

## AppDaemon and HADashboard configuration

This add-on does not configure the AppDaemon or HADashboard for you.
It does, however, create some sample files to get you started on the first run.

The configuration of the AppDaemon can be found in the `/config/appdaemon`
directory.

For more information about configuring AppDaemon, please refer to the
extensive documentation they offer:

<http://appdaemon.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>

## Home Assistant access tokens and ha_url settings

By default, this add-on ships without a `token` and without the `ha_url`
in the `appdaemon.yaml` config file. **This is not an error!**

The add-on takes care of these settings for you and you do not need to provide
or set these in the AppDaemon configuration.

This automatic handling of the URL and token conflicts with the AppDaemon
official documentation. The official documentation will state `ha_url` and
`token` options are required. For the add-on, these aren't needed.

However, you are free to set them if you want to override, however, in
general usage, that should not be needed and is not recommended for this add-on.
